## When to Use a Cash Receipt

Cash receipts are commonly used when:

- Payment is received immediately upon completion of work
- No invoice is required because payment has already been made
- The transaction needs to be documented for bookkeeping or tax records

Common examples include landscaping jobs, handyman services, equipment repairs, and other small contract work.

## What This Template Includes

The included HTML template is designed to capture the essential details of a legitimate cash transaction:

- Date of service
- Description of work performed
- Amount paid
- Payment method (cash)
- Business and customer information
- Space for acknowledgment or signature

The layout is intentionally minimal so it can be printed, saved as a PDF, or used on a mobile device.

## Important Note on Legitimacy

This template is meant to document real transactions.

Creating receipts for work that did not occur or altering details after the fact can create problems during audits or reviews. For best practices, receipts should be created at or near the time payment is received and should accurately reflect the transaction.

## When This Template Is Not Enough

For contractors who handle frequent cash jobs or need to document work while still on site, manually filling out templates can become inefficient.

In those cases, real-time receipt tools that capture job details immediately can reduce errors and missed documentation. Some contractors use voice-based tools like https://voiceinvoice.net to create legitimate receipts hands-free at the moment payment is received.
